TASK
The exercise is to implement an algorithm that can generate a list of 96 words.

a four-letter alphabet consisting of A, C, G and T.
Each word in the list must differ from every other word in the list in at least three positions.

Solution is done in two programming language in two different type of way. I used python to solve the problem and also I used C++ programming language to solve the problem.
